## About me
I’m Xiaotong “Kary” Fang, a PhD student at the University of Southern California working with [Payam Piray](https://www.piraylab.com/). My research focus on how humans learn and make decisions under uncertainty. 

I design behavioral tasks and incorporate computational models—such as Hidden Markov Models, Kalman filters, and particle filters—to uncover latent structures in noisy human data without relying on heavy assumptions. My goal is to transform messy clicks, choices, and timestamps into reliable signals that reveal how people adapt to changing environments. Beyond theory, I hope this research can translate into real-world applications, such as early indicators of mental-health risk based on behavior patterns. More recently, I’ve been extending this work into virtual reality, using pupillometry and eye-tracking to link behavioral adaptation with physiological signals. In addition, I am working on a compact RNN model that can explain learning mechanism across human and animal.

### My other interests
Outside the lab, I’m into rock climbing, snowboarding, tennis, running, and skateboarding. I also play the violin and piano for fun. I share my home with two cats and a Corgi—I really love animals.
